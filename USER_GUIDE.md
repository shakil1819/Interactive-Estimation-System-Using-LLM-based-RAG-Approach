# User Guide - Interactive Estimation System

This guide will help you navigate and use the Interactive Estimation System to get estimates for your projects.

## Getting Started

1. Open the application in your web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501)
2. You'll be greeted with a welcome message and the first question

## Conversation Flow

The system will guide you through a series of questions to gather information about your project:

1. **Service Type**: Specify what service you need (e.g., "roofing")
2. **Square Footage**: Indicate the approximate size of the area in square feet
3. **Location**: Specify your region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West)
4. **Material Type**: Choose your preferred material
   - For roofing: asphalt, metal, tile, or slate
5. **Timeline**: Indicate your preferred timeline
   - Standard: Regular scheduling
   - Expedited: Faster than normal (higher cost)
   - Emergency: Immediate service (highest cost)

## Providing Information

You can respond to questions in natural language. For example:

- "I need a new roof for my house"
- "The area is approximately 2,500 square feet"
- "I'm located in the Northeast region"
- "I'd prefer metal roofing materials"
- "This is not urgent, standard timeline is fine"

You can also provide multiple pieces of information at once:

- "I need a 1,500 square foot asphalt roof replacement in the Midwest with a standard timeline"

## Uploading Images

You can upload images of your project through the file uploader:

1. Click the "Upload Image" button
2. Select an image from your device
3. The system will acknowledge your upload and continue the conversation

- **Project Details**: Summary of your specifications
- **Cost Breakdown**: Itemized costs including:
  - Base Cost: Initial calculation based on square footage
  - Material Cost: Additional cost based on material choice
  - Regional Adjustment: Cost adjustment based on your location
  - Timeline Adjustment: Price adjustment based on urgency
