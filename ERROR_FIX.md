# Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: Expected a Runnable, callable or dict. Instead got an unsupported type: <class 'app.graph.MockLLM'>
Error loading configuration: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'config.json'
```

## Root Causes
1. **Custom MockLLM Implementation**: The custom `MockLLM` class didn't properly implement the LangChain Runnable protocol, causing compatibility issues with the LangChain pipelines.
2. **Missing Config File**: The application couldn't find the `config.json` file in the expected location.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed MockLLM Implementation
- Removed the custom `MockLLM` class entirely
- Replaced it with a simple `RunnablePassthrough` implementation that works properly with LangChain
- Created a standalone function `format_extraction_response` to handle information extraction
- Maintained the same extraction functionality but in a more compatible structure

### 2. Fixed Config File Loading
- Updated `config.py` to check multiple locations for the config file:
  - Custom location specified in environment variable
  - Current directory
  - Docker container root
  - Project root directory
  - Backend directory
- Added a default config in case no file is found
- Created a new `config.json` in the project root

## Benefits
- The application now uses standard LangChain components, making it more compatible
- More robust configuration file handling prevents errors
- The default configuration ensures the application works even without a config file

These changes allow the application to start properly in the Docker container and prevent the TypeError related to the MockLLM implementation.
