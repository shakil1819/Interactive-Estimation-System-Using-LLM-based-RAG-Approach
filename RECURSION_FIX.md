# GraphRecursionError Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was encountering a recursion error:
```
langgraph.errors.GraphRecursionError: Recursion limit of 100 reached without hitting a stop condition.
```

## Root Cause
The graph was creating an infinite loop because:
1. After `question_generator` generated a question, it transitioned back to `input_processor`
2. Since `user_input` was empty at that point, the system would cycle through the nodes again:
   - input_processor → information_extractor → state_updater → question_generator → input_processor (and repeat)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Graph Structure
- Changed the edge from `question_generator` to END instead of looping back to `input_processor`
- This ensures the graph execution terminates properly after generating a question

### 2. Updated Question Generator Function
- Modified `question_generator` to explicitly return `{"next": END}` 
- Changed its return type signature from `GraphState` to `Dict[str, str]` for clarity

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Increased the recursion limit from 100 to 250 to provide more flexibility
- Added try/except blocks in both `process_user_message` and `handle_image_upload` functions
- If an error occurs, we now:
  - Log the error for debugging
  - Add an error message to the conversation history
  - Return the input state to preserve the conversation context

## Benefits
- Prevents infinite recursion loops by ensuring the graph properly terminates
- Improves error handling to provide better user experience
- Preserves conversation state even if an error occurs
- More robust graph execution with appropriate termination points

These changes fix the immediate GraphRecursionError and provide a more robust foundation for the Interactive Estimation System.
